                            houlder injuries are one of the most common afflictions when it comes to calisthenics. The shoulder is involved in pretty much every upper body exercise. If you wish to minimize the chance of shoulder injuries, you must have proper mobility of the ball and socket joint. You must work on the external rotation of the shoulder to eliminate any possible impingement caused by an exercise like a muscle up. Last but not least, you must make sure your shoulder is warmed up before putting it through any type of exercise or stress. Stretching in my opinion is a MUST, because no matter how strong your shoulder is or how mobile it is, there is always a chance of injury if you are not properly warmed up.</p>

                        n calisthenics the back is one of the body parts we work the most. Like always make sure you’re warmed up! As far as avoiding injuries, you won’t have to worry if your back is strong enough unlike other body parts. If you have been doing calisthenics for any reasonable amount of time, your back will be strong and will only keep getting stronger. Back injuries while doing calisthenics are due to poor posture and a weak core. Make sure your back is in an appropriate posture and is secure. Your core should be tight to allow great energy transfer. It’s always possible to injure yourself if not properly warmed up. Getting to know your body is a big part of the process. So make sure you warm up your back muscles and stretch carefully before doing any exercise!</p>

                    n calisthenics there aren’t too many exercises that use the legs outside of pistol squats. This is why the health of the knee joints are often overlooked. It is very important to train the legs. The muscles in the lower body possess the largest muscles in the body. The knees are one of the areas that will benefit tremendously from leg training. So, training free weights outside of doing just calisthenics is recommended. Like every body part, you should make sure you warm up before doing any type of exercise or strenuous activity. To make sure that your knees are healthy, strengthening your muscles in your legs and lower body in general is essential. By doing so it will help put less stress on the knee joints. Flexibility is huge as it helps you maintain a healthy knee especially on days you don’t work out. So, make sure you are stretching your entire lower body every day.</p>
